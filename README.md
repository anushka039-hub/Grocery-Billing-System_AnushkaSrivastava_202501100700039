# Grocery-Billing-System_AnushkaSrivastava_202501100700039
This project is a Python-based Grocery Store Billing System developed to calculate the total cost of three purchased items.  The program accepts user input, computes the total amount, applies a 10% discount if the total exceeds $50, and displays the  original total, discount amount, and final payable amount.
